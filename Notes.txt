Controls:
1. Create a button on top right. Call it "Add".
2. Create a list view that displays all the users.
3. Create a TableView to edit user info.
4. On the tableview add a button called "Save".

App behaviour:
1. Have users click on Add button to add more users.
2. When users click on the Add button they must be directed to another page where they enter the info.
3. If users press back button then any update is discarded and its as if nothing happened.
4. Have users press the Save button to persist changes.
5. Nothing should be displayed on the home screen if there are no users added.
